			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I have been developing web applications and information systems
				for over ten years. Most of the time I worked as a full stack
				developer with orientation on PHP and SQL on the server side. On
				the frontend I worked for a long time without any frameworks,
				only in HTML, CSS (or Sass) and JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				In PHP, I programmed my own MVC for our family business and also
				a JS library similar to jQuery, which, however, always processes
				data as an array and is significantly smaller (easy to use
				built-in methods for arrays).
			</p>
			<p>
				I am now working on the transition to Frontend. I was fascinated
				by the React framework, so I decided to specialize in it. In
				addition to React, I am interested in NoSQL application
				solutions (MongoDB).
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				After ending my studies at UPOL, I felt the need to change the
				environment, so for some time I only worked only part-time in
				IT. I did programming after my job and in my free time, I worked
				mainly on projects that I enjoyed and for our small family
				business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now I want to return to the full-time IT profession - web
				application programming. Ideally a front end, but I also like to
				learn new technologies and programming languages (now I'm
				interested in Kotlin and Android development).
