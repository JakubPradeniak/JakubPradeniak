			<h1 class="skills__heading">About me</h1>
			<p class="skills__intro">
				My name is Jakub Pradeniak, I'm from Czechia and I'm webapp
				developer. Currently I'm focusing on web app frontend. I write
				apps in React but I can achieve the same outcome with pure
				HTML5/CSS3/JS (ES6).
			</p>
			<p class="skills__intro">
				I studied IT at Palacky University in Olomouc, I haven't
				finished my degree there, but I got solid understanding of
				algorithmic math, OOP and general programming patterns. During
				my studies at UPOL I learned C/C++/C#, Common Lisp and Assembly
				language.

			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">PHP</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I'm writing sever side programs in PHP for over 12
						years. I started to learn programming at grammar school
						and since then I'm self taught web app developer. I
						haven't used PHP frameworks much, because from the start
						it looked like overkill for small projects I worked on.
						After that I created my own solutions. Right now I'm working on e-commerce project.
					</p>
					<p>
						In PHP I wrote:
						<ul>
							<li>Infinity MVC - PHP framework utilizing MVC architecture and is powering most of BlueNet apps,</li>
							<li>Infinity REST - RESTful server written in PHP 8,</li>
							<li>Templator v0.1 - automatic template system inspired by Plates and Volt,</li>
							<li>Image processing class utilizing ImageMagick (I also made same class with GD),</li>
							<li>and many other smaller or bigger apps.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2 class="skill__heading">MySQL</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="9"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I'm using MySQL as main database system in apps I'm writing for 10+ years. I'm designing the database models and writing queries (mostly in PHP).
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">HTML(5)</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I wrote our very first website using good old HTML 4.1. Now I'm using HTML5, but mostly in some kind of processor which combines prepared elements into functional app (like PHP Templator etc.).
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">CSS(3)</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I'm styling apps UIs for 12+ years now. I like reusability so I'm trying to create elements and classes using BEM system. I also like animations and dynamic stuff made in pure CSS using simple transitions or keyframes for more complicated animations. I like to restyle built-in components like checkboxes, radiobuttons or file inputs with minimum of added elements (pseudo elements ::before and ::after are awesome :)).
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">Preprocessors PUG and Sass</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I can use PUG and Sass on same level as HTML and CSS. In PUG I made some templates for apps which are assembled by PHP Templator. I styled almost every app using Sass until 2022/2021.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">JavaScript</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I'm programming in JavaScript since 2010. I started with pure JS on ES5 standard, then I was using jQuery for years. When ES6 came out I slowly abandoned jQuery and again started to program in pure JS.
					</p>
					<p>
						In JavaScript I wrote:
						<ul>
							<li>Thunder - tiny jQuery like framework which works similar to jQuery but fully utilizes power of arrays and is really small,</li>
							<li>Editor (RTE) - rich text editor,</li>
							<li>PageBuilder - overhaul of previous RTE which can edit whole blocks on page and whole pages as well,</li>
							<li>Snowy - tiny program which lets you to start snowing on your page,</li>
							<li>GEngine - simple game engine with limited physics which renders on HTML canvas (designed for games like Tetris or Mario clones),</li>
							<li>Charty - graph plotting,</li>
							<li>and many more utilities and apps.</li>

				<h2 class="skill__heading">CoffeeScript preprocessor</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="10"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I was using CoffeeScript for few years. I built first prototype of Thunder with it and some simple JS for web apps.

			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">TypeScript</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="5"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						TypeScript as superset of JS bringing features of strongly typed languages is great. I evaluate my knowledge of it into mid range, but if needed I can learn it quickly to higher level. Right now I'm trying TS with React.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="skill">
				<h2 class="skill__heading">ReactJS</h2>
				<div class="skill__level" data-level="5"></div>
				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I started using ReactJS as my main tool for frontend development at the start of 2022. Thanks to my long experience with JavaScript the learning curve is very steep. I dare say that as of now I'm mid-level React developer able to use React classes as well as functional approach using React hooks. Fetching data from API is easy (I programmed our own REST server for these purposes), deconstructing app into reusable components is natural for me, because I was using similar approach with our PHP template processor. Right now I'm working on my own blog using React, PHP and MySQL.
					</p>
					<p>
						In React I wrote:
						<ul>
							<li>Profotky app - photographers blog and photo bank (something like Pixabay on Unsplash, but with articles as bonus),</li>
							<li>some custom hooks for routinely used functionality like localStorage or cookies,</li>
							<li>single page placeholder website to give info about upcoming app,</li>
							<li>utility to help colleagues with their daily work with clients (something like minutes from meeting - app helps with automatic client data filling, document templates, standardized design for print etc.),</li>
							<li>and many more tiny apps and exercise styled programs.</li>

				<div class="skill__description">
					<p>
						I learned C# at Palacky university. It is fun to work wit it, because it is easy to learn language and it is also easy to create windows apps in it. Unfortunately I haven't used it in few years as of now.

			<p class="skills__outro">
				I'm using Visual Studio Code for web apps development, Android Studio and VS Code for Android apps development, Visual Studio 2019 for C/C++ development and UE5 for game development (learning now). When I work with graphics I'm using GIMP, Krita and Inkscape, for photo editing I use Polar alongside with GIMP. When I'm modeling in 3D I use Blender.

				At all of the skills above I evaluated my skill level according to my personal opinion/feeling.
